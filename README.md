# street-parking-map

A map indicating controlled parking spaces in the city of Thessaloniki.

There are two types of parking spaces:

* Resident spaces: where residents with a permit park for free
* Visitors spaces: where drivers pay per parking minute

The map also indicates the kiosks where people can pay for parking (if they do not use the app).

A live version of the map can be found at https://nicolaus.gr/parkpal/
